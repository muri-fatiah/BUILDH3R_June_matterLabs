# Build smart contract
This learning journey provided a comprehensive foundation in Ethereum smart contract creation, deployment, and interaction. Engaging in practical exercises and documenting progress on GitHub allowed me to gain hands-on knowledge and build a relevant code portfolio. I became proficient in creating ERC20 tokens, managing hashed messages on the blockchain, and automating interactions with smart contracts via ethers.js. Moreover, I delved into zkSync and paymasters for managing transaction fees and token balances.
